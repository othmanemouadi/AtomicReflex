# Gameplay

- A **target element** (name, symbol, atomic number, atomic mass) is shown.
- Multiple circles fall from the top of the screen, each labeled with a chemical symbol.
- Only **one symbol matches the target**.

# Rules
-  Click the **correct symbol** → gain score and combo
-  Click a **wrong symbol** → no life lost, combo reset, small score penalty
-  Let the **correct symbol hit the floor** → lose a life
-  Let **wrong symbols** fall → no penalty

Game ends when all lives are lost.
